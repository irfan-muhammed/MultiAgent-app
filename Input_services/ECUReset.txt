9.3 ECUReset (0x11) service
9.3.1 Service description
The ECUReset service is used by the client to request a server reset.
This service requests the server to effectively perform a server reset based on the content of the resetType
parameter value embedded in the ECUReset request message. The ECUReset positive response message (if
required) shall be sent before the reset is executed in the server(s). After a successful server reset the server
shall activate the defaultSession.
IMPORTANT — The server and the client shall meet the request and response message behaviour as
specified in 7.5.
This part of ISO 14229 does not define the behaviour of the ECU from the time following the positive response
message to the ECU reset request until the reset has successfully completed. It is recommended that during
this time the ECU does not accept any request messages and send any response messages.
9.3.2 Request message
9.3.2.1 Request message definition
Table 33 defines the request message definition.
Table 33 — Request message definition
A_Data byte Parameter Name Cvt Byte Value Mnemonic
#1 ECUReset Request SID M 0x11 ER
#2 sub-function = [ resetType ] M 0x00 – 0xFF LEV_RT_
9.3.2.2 Request message sub-function Parameter $Level (LEV_) definition
The sub-function parameter resetType is used by the ECUReset request message to describe how the server
has to perform the reset (suppressPosRspMsgIndicationBit (bit 7) not shown).
Table 34 defines the request message sub-function parameter definition.

Bits 6 – 0 Description Cvt Mnemonic
0x00 ISOSAEReserved M ISOSAERESRVD
This value is reserved by this document.
0x01 hardReset U HR
This value identifies a "hard reset" condition which simulates the power-on /
start-up sequence typically performed after a server has been previously
disconnected from its power supply (i.e. battery). The performed action is
implementation specific and not defined by the standard. It might result in the
re-initialization of both volatile memory and non-volatile memory locations to
predetermined values.

Bits 6 – 0 Description Cvt Mnemonic
0x02 keyOffOnReset U KOFFONR
This value identifies a condition similar to the driver turning the ignition key off
and back on. This reset condition should simulate a key-off-on sequence (i.e.
interrupting the switched power supply). The performed action is
implementation specific and not defined by the standard. Typically the values
of non-volatile memory locations are preserved; volatile memory will be
initialized.
0x03 softReset U SR
This value identifies a "soft reset" condition, which causes the server to
immediately restart the application program if applicable. The performed
action is implementation specific and not defined by the standard. A typical
action is to restart the application without reinitializing of previously learned
configuration data, adaptive factors and other long-term adjustments.
0x04 enableRapidPowerShutDown U ERPSD
This subfunction applies to ECUs which are not ignition powered but battery
powered only. Therefore a shutdown forces the sleep mode rather than a
power off. Sleep means power off but still ready for wake-up (battery
powered). The intention of the subfunction is to reduce the stand-by time of
an ECU after ignition is turned into the off position.
This value requests the server to enable and perform a "rapid power shut
down" function. The server shall execute the function immediately once the
"key/ignition” is switched off. While the server executes the power down
function, it shall transition either directly or after a defined stand-by-time to
sleep mode. If the client requires a response message and the server is
already prepared to execute the "rapid power shut down" function, the server
shall send the positive response message prior to the start of the "rapid
power shut down" function. The next occurrence of a "key on" or "ignition on"
signal terminates the "rapid power shut down" function.
NOTE This sub-function is only applicable to a server supporting a
stand-by-mode!
0x05 disableRapidPowerShutDown U DRPSD
This value requests the server to disable the previously enabled "rapid power
shut down" function.

9.3.3.2 Positive response message data-parameter definition
Table 36 defines the data-parameters of the response message.
Table 36 — Response message data-parameter definition
Definition
resetType
This parameter is an echo of bits 6 - 0 of the sub-function parameter from the request message.
powerDownTime
This parameter indicates to the client the minimum time of the stand-by-sequence the server will remain in the power
down sequence.
The resolution of this parameter is one (1) second per count.
The follwing values are valid:
⎯ 0x00 – 0xFE: 0 – 254 seconds powerDownTime,
⎯ 0xFF: indicates a failure or time not available.
9.3.4 Supported negative response codes (NRC_)
The following negative response codes shall be implemented for this service. The circumstances under which
each response code would occur are documented in Table 37. The listed negative responses shall be used if
the error scenario applies to the server.

9.3.5 Message flow example ECUReset
This subclause specifies the conditions for the example to be fulfilled to successfully perform an ECUReset
service in the server.
Condition of server: ignition = on, system shall not be in an operational mode (e.g. if the system is an engine
management, engine shall be off).
The client requests to have a response message by setting the suppressPosRspMsgIndicationBit (bit 7 of the
sub-function parameter) to 'FALSE'.
The server shall send an ECUReset positive response message before the server performs the resetType.
