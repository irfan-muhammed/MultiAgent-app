9.2 DiagnosticSessionControl (0x10) service
9.2.1 Service description
The DiagnosticSessionControl service is used to enable different diagnostic sessions in the server(s).
A diagnostic session enables a specific set of diagnostic services and/or functionality in the server(s). This
service provides the capability that the server(s) can report data link layer specific parameter values valid for
the enabled diagnostic session (e.g. timing parameter values). The user of this International Standard shall
define the exact set of services and/or functionality enabled in each diagnostic session.
There shall always be exactly one diagnostic session active in a server. A server shall always start the default
diagnostic session when powered up. If no other diagnostic session is started, then the default diagnostic
session shall be running as long as the server is powered.
A server shall be capable of providing diagnostic functionality under normal operating conditions and in other
operation conditions defined by the vehicle manufacturer (e.g., limp home operation condition).
If the client has requested a diagnostic session, which is already running, then the server shall send a positive
response message and behave as shown in Figure 7 that describes the server internal behaviour when
transitioning between sessions.
Whenever the client requests a new diagnostic session, the server shall send the DiagnosticSessionControl
positive response message before the timings of the new session become active in the server. Some
situations may require that the new session must be entered before the positive response is sent while
maintaining the old protocol timings for sending the response. If the server is not able to start the requested
new diagnostic session, then it shall respond with a DiagnosticSessionControl negative response message
and the current session shall continue (see diagnosticSession parameter definitions for further information on
how the server and client shall behave). The set of diagnostic services and diagnostic functionality in a non-
default diagnostic session (excluding the programmingSession) is a superset of the functionality provided in
the defaultSession, which means that the diagnostic functionality of the defaultSession is also available when
switching to any non-default diagnostic session. A session can enable vehicle manufacturer specific services
and functions, which are not part of this document.
To start a new diagnostic session a server may request that certain conditions be fulfilled. All such conditions
are user defined. Examples of such conditions are:

ISO 14229-1:2013(E)
⎯ The server may only allow a client with a certain client identifier (client diagnostic address) to start a
specific new diagnostic session (e.g. a server may require that only a client having the client identifier
0xF4 may start the extendedDiagnosticSession).
⎯ Certain safety conditions may need to be satisfied (e.g., vehicle shall not be moving or engine shall not be
running).
In some systems it is desirable to change communication-timing parameters when a new diagnostic session is
started. The DiagnosticSessionControl service entity can use the appropriate service primitives to change the
timing parameters as specified for the underlying layers to change communication timing in the local node and
potentially in the nodes the client wants to communicate with.
Figure 7 provides an overview about the diagnostic session transition and what the server shall do when it
transitions to another session.

Key
1 default session: When the server is in the defaultSession and the client requests to start the defaultSession then the
server shall re-initialize the defaultSession completely. The server shall reset all activated/initiated/changed
settings/controls during the activated session. This does not include long term changes programmed into non-volatile
memory.
2 other session: When the server transitions from the defaultSession to any other session than the defaultSession then
the server shall only stop the events (similar to stopResponseOnEvent) that have been configured in the server via
the ResponseOnEvent (0x86) service during the defaultSession.
3 same or other session: When the server transitions from any diagnostic session other than the defaultSession to
another session other than the defaultSession (including the currently active diagnostic session) then the server shall
(re-) initialize the diagnostic session, which means that:
i) Each event that has been configured in the server via the ResponseOnEvent (0x86) service shall be stopped.
ii) Security shall be relocked. Note that the locking of security access shall reset any active diagnostic functionality that
was dependent on security access to be unlocked (e.g., active inputOutputControl of a DID).
iii) All other active diagnostic functionality that is supported in the new session and is not dependent upon security
access shall be maintained. For example, any configured periodic scheduler shall remain active when transitioning
from one non-defaultSession to another or the same non-DefaultSession and the states of the CommunicationControl
and ControlDTCSetting services shall not be affected, which means that normal communication shall remain disabled
when it is disabled at the point in time the session is switched.
4 default session: When the server transitions from any diagnostic session other than the default session to the
defaultSession then the server shall stop each event that has been configured in the server via the
ResponseOnEvent (0x86) service and security shall be enabled. Any other active diagnostic functionality that is not
supported in the defaultSession shall be terminated. For example, any configured periodic scheduler or output control
shall be disabled and the states of the CommunicationControl and ControlDTCSetting services shall be reset, which
means that normal communication shall be re-enabled when it was disabled at the point in time the session is
switched to the defaultSession. The server shall reset all activated/initiated/changed settings/controls during the
activated session. This does not include long term changes programmed into non-volatile memory.

b Secured dataIdentifiers require a SecurityAccess service and therefore a non-default diagnostic session.
c Secured memory areas require a SecurityAccess service and therefore a non-default diagnostic session.
d A dataIdentifier can be defined dynamically in the default and non-default diagnostic session.
e Secured routines require a SecurityAccess service and therefore a non-default diagnostic session. A routine that requires to be
stopped actively by the client also requires a non-default session.

0x01 defaultSession M DS
This diagnostic session enables the default diagnostic session in the server(s)
and does not support any diagnostic application timeout handling provisions
(e.g. no TesterPresent service is necessary to keep the session active).
If any other session than the defaultSession has been active in the server and
the defaultSession is once again started, then the following implementation
rules shall be followed (see also the server diagnostic session state diagram
given above):
The server shall stop the current diagnostic session when it has sent the
DiagnosticSessionControl positive response message and shall start the
newly requested diagnostic session afterwards.
If the server has sent a DiagnosticSessionControl positive response message
it shall have re-locked the server if the client unlocked it during the diagnostic
session.
If the server sends a negative response message with the
DiagnosticSessionControl request service identifier the active session shall be
continued.
NOTE In case the used data link requires an initialization step then the
initialized server(s) shall start the default diagnostic session by default. No
DiagnosticSessionControl with diagnosticSession set to defaultSession shall
be required after the initialization step.
